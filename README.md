## Contributions

Contributions to Tracker are welcome. If you want any new feature (even if it's in later milestone or no milestone at all) you are free to do so. It is recommended to consult on larger issues as they might collide with some future system revamps and might not be merged because of it.

### Translations

Tracker uses Crowdin to crowdsource translations. You can help with translating the application today at [https://crowdin.com/project/advention](https://crowdin.com/project/advention).

## Versioning

For readability it's separeted by spaces and underscores however these are not present it the actual versioning, see example.
YEAR.VERSION RELEASE BUILD_NUMBER

Eg. 2020.1β1

### Releases

New releases will be developed in seperate branches and always have up to date version codes so it is easier to know in what state the release is.

#### Iota ι

Early internal builds after significant changes. Not recommended for use by anyone else but developers. In the future these should be built under different id. These builds might not even have migrations in place.

#### Alpha α

Early test builds usually bringing new features. These builds are not yet feature complete but should have migrations for database and be stable in a way that some basic actions do not crash them every time.

#### Beta β

Late test builds that are feature complete (no new features should be added in these builds, only bugfixes). These builds are meant for general testers that want to test the app but also use it regularly. While there will probably be some issues and crashes, these should be rather sparse and mostly contain edge cases and issues that were not found in the Alpha or Iota builds.

#### Release

Most stable releases meant for general public
